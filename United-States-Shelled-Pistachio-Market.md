Online sales allow brands to offer a wide range of pistachio products, from raw to roasted, salted, or flavored, catering to diverse consumer preferences. In addition, e-commerce platforms enable direct-to-consumer relationships, which can help brands build stronger customer loyalty through subscription models or personalized recommendations.

Additionally, large retail chains and grocery stores often feature shelled pistachios as part of their health food or nut sections, attracting consumers who are specifically seeking nutritious snack options.
